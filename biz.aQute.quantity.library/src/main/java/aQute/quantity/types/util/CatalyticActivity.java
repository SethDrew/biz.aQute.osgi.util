/**
 * 
 * The katal (symbol: kat) is the SI unit of catalytic activity.[1] It is a
 * derived SI unit for quantifying the catalytic activity of enzymes (measuring
 * the enzymatic activity level in enzyme catalysis) and other catalysts. Its
 * use is recommended by the General Conference on Weights and Measures and
 * other international organizations. It replaces the non-SI enzyme unit. Enzyme
 * units are, however, still more commonly used than the katal in practice at
 * present, especially in biochemistry.
 * 
 * The katal is not used to express the rate of a reaction; that is expressed in
 * units of concentration per second (or moles per liter per second). Rather, it
 * is used to express catalytic activity which is a property of the catalyst.
 * The katal is invariant of the measurement procedure, but the numerical
 * quantity value is not and depends on the experimental conditions. Therefore,
 * in order to define the quantity of a catalyst, the rate of conversion of a
 * defined chemical reaction is specified as mols reacted per second. One katal
 * of trypsin, for example, is that amount of trypsin which breaks a mole of
 * peptide bonds per second under specified conditions.
